# @temboplus/afloat

**A foundational library for Temboplus-Afloat projects.**

This JavaScript/TypeScript package provides a central hub for shared utilities, logic, and data access mechanisms within the Temboplus-Afloat ecosystem. 

## Key Features

* **Abstracted Server Communication**
    * Simplifies front-end development by abstracting all interactions with the server behind model-specific repositories
    * Front-end projects only need to interact with these repositories, decoupling them from the underlying API implementation

* **Shared Utilities**
    * Provides a collection of reusable helper functions for common tasks across Afloat projects, such as error handling

* **Data Models**
    * Defines standardized data structures and interfaces for consistent data representation throughout the Afloat ecosystem

* **Enhanced Maintainability**
    * Centralizes common logic, making it easier to maintain and update across all consuming projects
    * Reduces code duplication and improves consistency
